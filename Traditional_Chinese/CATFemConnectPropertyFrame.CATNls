The clearance is the minimum distance between\nthe geometries of the two sides of the connection.\n
- a positive value means that the surfaces can still\ncome closer until they come in contact.\n
- a negative value means that the surfaces are overlaped\nand they will naturally be pushed them apart.\n\nd  =  clearance";
